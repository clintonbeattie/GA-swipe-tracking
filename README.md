# GA-swipe-tracking
Script to track swipe actions on touch devices. Handy for testing usage of components such as galleries, slideshows etc

I initially used this script to run a series of tests on responsive tables to check what UX Designs worked best to alert a user to the fact that a table expanding off-screen was swipeable/scrollable horizontally.
